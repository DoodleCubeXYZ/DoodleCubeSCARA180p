# DoodleCubeSCARA180p
Development & Files for My 5 Bar Parallel SCARA 3D Printer


The DoodleCube SCARA180p is a 5 Bar Parallel SCARA 3D Printer utilizing simple planetary gearboxes with preloading mechanisms to erase gear backlash instead of relying on bulky Belt/Pully systems. Currently This simplifies construction but requires the motion system to be the fixed axis with a bed moving in the Z axis. Eventually I may develop a more compact preloading mechanism or produce a more traditional pully drive arm for a larger SCARA. This design is primarily a proof of concept.

Files will be available here for your own DoodleCube SCARA builds.

Printer designed to run on a Duet 2 Wifi or similar board running any version of Reprap that supports 5 Bar Kinematics.
